      <h4>About this Event</h4>
      <p>STEM Fellowship SFU hosted a networking session for students interested in learning how to navigate the new virtual professional world. For students that are transitioning into the workplace this time is an important one, and the traditional methods of networking are not viable anymore. People who learn to network successfully are prized in the job market. Networking is about establishing relationships with people typically in your field, such as working professionals, experts and professors. Connections you establish during your time in university could result in internships and post-graduation opportunities. The purpose of networking is to form relationships with those who can help you get to where you need to go, and the earlier you start building your network, the better! </p> <p>We hosted Tara Furiani to talk about all things networking and recruiting. Tara Furiani is the Executive Strategist, Speaker, Writer,  Producer and Host of Not The HR Lady, which airs on over 100 podcast and videocast formats such as iTunes, Spotify, YouTube, TikTok and more! </p>
